        <br>
        schnigula the snail here with a peculiar piece of wisdom: 
        <br>
        when life gets too fast, take a leaf out of my shell and slow down. 
        <br>
        embrace your inner spiral, savor the moments, and remember, 
        <br>
        it's okay to carry your home with you. 
        <br>
        after all, the best journeys are often the ones taken at a snail's pace!" üêå‚ú® </p>
