<marquee> Uh, Can I get the beat up a little bit? (Fine)
Don't leave
Please
I reckon that you're everything I need
Uh, I know I'm getting grumpy in the week
Sleeping in each others pockets living up each others sleeves
Its the greed
I know you hate that money plants the seed
I hate the thought you don't believe
In me, Reckon that I couldn't take the lead just
Become another one who milks the sun until it bleeds
Yo I think about my best days
With you at home marking essays
Pouring glasses of sparkling presse
We raise a toast then an oven toast
Making a roast thinking I can hold you close when the best strays
But it if lost I wonder who's to know
I pay the cost of all this to and fro
It's like a frostbite blue with snow
The day we lost Carluccio, uh, uh
Uh, the thought makes me cry and i'm embarrassed
Thinking bout the nights out in Paris, evening
Swimming in the deep end
Wishing I was savage
Saying she ain't believing in marriage but times change
Now its all a house out in Italy
Ceremony in Sicily
The dreams so bitter sweet
Uh, cos when I close my eyes all I see is she
Shit, I'm hoping she can picture me
Or maybe picture kids with a Frisbee
It's bad tendencies yo' I'm 'keeping em with me
I think it's risky
I reckon that she missed me
We go together like the Nike airs and crisp tees
But it we don't I wonder who's to know
I pay the cost of all this to and fro
It's like a frostbite blue with snow
The way we lost Carluccio
Ch'yeah
Uh, uh the way we lost Carluccio
I said
The way way we lost Carluccio
Uh
The way we lost Carluccio
On the day that we lost Carluccio
The way we lost Carluccio
You'll never be the worst to the first
Or better than the last
The less we asked to start our own little past
I ain't thinking that fast
I said, I ain't thinking that fast
'Cos when the honey moon blast and the day lights
Passed we raise glass to the past sitting back on our arse
And we loved yeah
And we love (There fuck it)
